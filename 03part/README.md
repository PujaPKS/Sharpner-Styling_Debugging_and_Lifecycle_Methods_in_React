Revision Project - Add User Form

Deliverables:

1. In the AddUser component return a form.
2. Inside the form, create an input element for collecting Username. It should have "username" as its id and must be attached to the relevant label element.
3. Create one more input element for collecting Age. It should have "age" as its id and must be attached to the relevant label element.
4. Finally, add a button of type "submit" with text "Add User". This completes the form.
5. Now, listen for submit event on form with the help of a handler function, name it "addUserHandler".
6. Inside the handler, prevent the default behavior of form submission.
7. Now, import the AddUser component in the App component and plug it in between the enclosing div.
